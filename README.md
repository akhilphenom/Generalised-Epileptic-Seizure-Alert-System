# Generalised-Epileptic-Seizure-Alert-System

This project has many steps to understand. 
Everything is clearly documented along with source files and their description 
You can download the pdf as it can give clear insights of hardware and software code snippets, the working and output format

For now, the java files in the repo are source files to understand how Bluetooth transfer happens from a hardware like hc-05 or hc-06.
Pairing of devices and active listening is quite a bit hard as apps drain battery as background processes. So we used handler in code to minimise usage by effectively pairing only 
when required.

The jpeg image in repo is a sum up of the project.

Further Development:
Use a miniature Dev-Board that supports python IDE to deploy machine learning models so as to additionally run algorithms like - Fall detection, EEG analysis (most effective)
The project we did was fair and big, but it is yet to be optimised.
We gave up because it's not budfget friendly. But the viewers can always improve on it
